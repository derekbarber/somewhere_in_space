# Somewhere in Space

This is a fun, little 2D game that was originally written by Derek Barber using the 
[*Allegro Game Programming Library*](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/) and
the DJGPP compiler under DOS.

Current work involves updating the code to work with the newer
Allegro 5 and bring in support for other platforms such as OS X.
